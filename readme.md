## SELDOM README
This game is basically a tech demo. It was made for creator week https://naoamaya.tumblr.com/post/622525685827862528/naoamaya-creator-week-24th-31st-july-hello <br>
THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME. It will never be. This was made just to see if I can make a working prototype in a week.

All of the art assets, UI elements and Code was made by me.
I am releasing this, along with the source code under the MIT licence. I don't have a lawyer. Please don't sue me.

## How to Run
Download the relase found to the right of this pannel, ~~unless github decided to change its layout. In which case you're on your own.~~ Extract the folder using your favorite program of choice (mine is Windows Explorer) and run Seldom.exe.
If your antivirus gets annoyed at it ~~(mine did)~~ click "run anyway". If I knew how to make a virus I wouldn't be making self depreciating jokes in a readme for a game. Don't belive me? You can read the source ~~spaghetti~~ code.

## Gameplay
~~There is almost none.~~
The premise for the game: The player must locate completely random objects in the world and sell them to people to make money. This money could then be used to secure lodging or buy food to survive, if I somehow managed to get that far into developing this.
Right now the player can wonder about a forest, pick up some items and sell one of them to an old man. (Yes, I am aware that this is a bug. No, I am not going to fix it)
I've tried to make the dialog interaction interesting at least. Hope that turned out good.

## Controls
Keyboard:
* WASD - Move
* E - Interact
* Q - Open inventory
* Esc - Open pause menu

Controller:
* NOTE - I have not implemented a way for a controler to navigate the UI. You're going to have to use a mouse.
* NOTE#2 - I've only tested this with a Xbox One controller. Don't yell at me if your ps4 or switch controler doesn't work. 
* Left stick - move
* A - Interact
* B - Pause Menu
* X - Inventory

## FAQ
Why can't I see all the dialog?
* You see those white bars off to the side? Those are scroll bars. You can scroll them. Click and drag, scroll wheel, whatever.

Where are my Mac/Linux/Insert other OS here Releases?
* Couldn't be bothered to install the build support for anything other than windows. (I tried windows universal development platform before realising you need a licence) You can probably clone the project and build it yourslef.

-blank- doesn't work!
* It's my first game, cut me some slack. I'm not updating or patching this mess. I'm already working on my next game.

Your readme is a mess!
* If you can write me a better one feel free. I'm not going to stop you.
