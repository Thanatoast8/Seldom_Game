## SELDOM README
This game is basically a tech demo. It was made for creator week //LINK
THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME. It will never be. This was made just to see if I can make a working prototype in a week.

All of the art assets, UI elements and Code was made by me.
I am releasing this, along with the source code under the MIT licence. I don't have a lawyer. Please don't sue me.
